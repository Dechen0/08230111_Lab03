            Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is <b>Dechen Dorji</b>.  
            I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Education at <i>Samtse College of Education.</i>
            <br>  
            <br>
            I'm a passionate education student who loves exploring creative ways to make learning enjoyable and meaningful. I strongly believe that teaching is not just about delivering lessons, but about creating experiences that inspire curiosity and a love for learning. With a keen interest in ICT and modern teaching strategies, I enjoy using technology to make lessons more interactive, practical, and engaging for students.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to build a classroom environment where every learner feels valued, supported, and motivated to grow. I want to encourage students to think critically, collaborate with their peers, and connect their learning to real-world situations. For me, education is about empowering young minds to be confident, creative, and responsible individuals who can make a positive difference in their communities.
